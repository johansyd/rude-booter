- Have you ever spent weeks trying to bootstrap a project?
- Did you ever deploy directly to a sub-folder on your prosduction server because there wasn't enough time to set up a decent staging and/or development environment?
- Did you ever work year-in and year-out on a project because nobody else knew how to get the project up and running.

If you did, we know exactly how you feel.

We made [*The Rude Booter*](https://github.com/johansyd/rude-booter) because we believe it should be easy to bootstrap new developers and projects.
