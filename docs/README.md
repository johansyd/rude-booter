- Have you ever spent weeks trying to bootstrap a project?
- Did you ever deploy directly to a sub-folder on your prosduction server because there wasn't enough time to set up a decent staging and/or development environment?
- Did you ever work year-in and year-out on a project because nobody else knew how to get the project up and running.

If you did, we know exactly how you feel.

We made [*The Rude Booter*](https://github.com/johansyd/rude-booter) because we believe it should be easy to bootstrap new developers and projects.
It shouldn't matter whether you use Windows, Mac or Linux. Bootstrapping your projects should happen the same way running just one command.

    bash <(\curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johansyd/rude-booter/master/scripts/install.sh")
    
And...
