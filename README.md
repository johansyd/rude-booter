# rude-booter
The rude booter may curse and swear at you, but he will also bootstrap your development environment.

## Setup

You should setup a vagrant bootstrap project on github.

the VagrantFile should be in the folder: `./vagrant`
If you want to install vagrant plugins as part of the installation. add a file at the base of your project with the name: `vagrant_plugins`
Each plugin should be on a separate line.
Th Rude Booter will clone out all your projects in a folder that you specify. You can use this fact to setup your projects as vhosts that can be used by vagrant to provision them as shared folders.
The Rude Booter can also run a installation script for each of your projects. Just specify the path to the installation file during the installation process. By default, the Rude Booter will use `scripts/install.sh` from the base of any github project that you have told it to clone.
